# DefiningOwnFunctions
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 23

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a Python file called “myFunction.py” in this folder.
● Create your own function that prints all the days of the week.
● Create your own function that takes in a sentence and replaces every
second word with the word “Hello”

Compulsory Task 2
● Follow these steps:
● Create a Python file called holiday.py in this folder.
● You will need to create four functions:
● HotelCost - This function will take the number of nights a user will
be staying at a hotel as an argument and return a total cost for the
hotel stay (You can choose the price per night charged at the
hotel).
● PlaneCost - This function will take the city you are flying to as an
argument and return a cost for the flight (Hint: use if/else if
statements in the function to retrieve a price based on the chosen
city).
● CarRental - This function will take the number of days the car will
be hired for as an argument and returns the total cost of the car
rental .
● HolidayCost - This function will take three arguments: the number
of nights a user will be staying in a hotel, the city the user will be
flying to and the number of days that the user will be hiring a car
for. Using these three arguments, you can call all three of the
above functions with respective arguments and finally return a
total cost for your holiday.
● Print out all the details about the holiday in a meaningful way!
● Try using your app with different combinations of input to show it’s
compatibility with different options.
